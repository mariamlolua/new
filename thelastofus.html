        <h1>gameplay</h1>
         <p>The Last of Us is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, buildings, forests, and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie, across the United States. The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment and briefly controls Joel's daughter, Sarah, in the opening sequence.
            In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and short-range weapons such as a handgun and a short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies.[6] The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as health kits, shivs, and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged by finding edible items or through the use of health kits.

Marlene reveals they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back.

   <div id="others">
    <h1>Other characters</h1>
    <ul>

       <li> Maria (Ashley Scott) is Tommy's wife, and Joel's sister-in-law. Maria and her father ran a settlement in Jackson County shortly after the outbreak of the infection. When Joel and Ellie visit the settlement, Maria opposes Joel's suggestion for Tommy to escort Ellie to the Fireflies, as she is scared he would come to danger. Ultimately, Joel continues on his journey with Ellie, and Tommy returns to the settlement with Maria. The team aimed for Maria's clothing and demeanor to reflect her "strong and fiercely capable nature".: 95  Scott auditioned for the role of Tess; when the team required an actor for Maria, they immediately contacted Scott. She reprised the role for The Last of Us Part II.Rutina Wesley plays Maria in the HBO adaptation.</li>

 <li>James (Reuben Langdon) is David's assistant. He is hunting with David upon their encounter with Ellie, during which he is ordered to gather some supplies from their base. When he returns, he discovers Ellie holding David at gunpoint but is ordered to avoid conflict; Ellie ultimately leaves. When David later captures Ellie, he and James prepare to kill her, restraining her against a table. When Ellie informs them of her infection, James' grip loosens, and Ellie takes advantage of this by stabbing him with a knife, killing him. Druckmann felt Langdon added a dynamic between James and David, in which there is conflict between the two characters, but they still respect each other. Troy Baker plays James in the HBO television adaptation.</li>
 <li>Frank is Bill's ex-partner. A letter that Frank wrote before killing himself reveals Bill's growing paranoia and set-in-his-ways attitude had led to the end of their relationship, and Frank had been intending to take the usable battery, fix up a car and escape Bill's town for good.[51] Frank was portrayed by Murray Bartlett in the HBO television adaptation.</l1>
 <li>Ish is an unseen survivor. Through a series of letters, notes and diary entries found over the course of the sewer mission in the Suburbs, it is revealed Ish, a fisherman by profession, had set up shelter in a sewer just after beaching his boat, and later accepted some travelers who had children with them to join him. Over some time, the sewers had turned into a thriving commune, but it came to an end when, after someone accidentally left a door to the outside open, a swarm of infected attacked and killed many of the inhabitants. A final note from Ish in one of the nearby houses reveals he had made it out alive with a few people. Kotaku called the story of Ish "the hardest lesson" learned in The Last of Us: Ish is a better person than Joel, but his kindness got other people killed.</li>
